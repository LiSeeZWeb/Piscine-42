Git repository with coding developed at Piscine42 Malaga


## Skills developed during the piscine
Self-learning :
	 is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology.
	There are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling,
	enquiring your classmates, and empirical knowledge.

Teamwork :
	On weekends, a 24h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

Time management :
	The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
	they want, which demands excellent time management skills for not "drowning" amid the
	massive load of work demanded by the program.


## Technologies learned 

C Language :
	The primary language learned at the 42 piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and makefile.

Shell :
	The first two days of the program are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.
 
Git :
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands pisciners to
	be at ease with such a system.
